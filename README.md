# NASM Support for Xcode 7.2.1+#
1. download the two files (Add-NASM.sh, NASM.xclangspec)
2. Open Add-Lua.sh and change the DVTFOUNDATION_PATH if necessary.  You probably do not need to change this if you are on Xcode 7.2.1+
3. Make sure Xcode is closed
4. Run Add-NASM.sh from the terminal with sudo (I.E. 'sudo Add-NASM.sh')
5. Enter your admin password and hit enter
6. Open Xcode and notice the 'NASM' entry under "Editor->Syntax Coloring"


Special thanks to [araxara](https://github.com/araxara) for the Objective-J version of this code.
